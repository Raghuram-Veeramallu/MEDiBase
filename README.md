According to our studies we have found out that around 45% of the world population are living in Rural Areas where the medical facilities are limited. Also around 16-17% of the world population are still illiterate and do not know the importance of maintaing their medical records and history. So we came up with a solution to store their records on a Centralised Data Storage System.

#### Key Technology Stack:
Angular 8
Node Backend
